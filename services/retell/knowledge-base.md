## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you offer free consultations?
Yes! We offer a free 30-minute discovery call to understand your business and see if we're a good fit. No pressure, no obligation.

### What areas do you serve?
We're based in Kyle, Texas (just south of Austin), but we work with clients nationwide. Most of our communication happens over video calls, email, and phone.

### How quickly can you start?
For most projects, we can kick off within 1-2 weeks of signing. For urgent needs, we can sometimes accommodate faster timelines.

### Do you offer payment plans?
Yes, for larger projects like website development, we typically split payments into milestones. Monthly services are billed monthly.

### What's your cancellation policy?
Monthly services require 30 days notice to cancel. We don't lock you into long-term contracts — we'd rather earn your business every month.

Our minimum engagement is typically $1,000 for one-time projects or $750/month for ongoing services.

### What makes you different from other agencies?
We're a small, focused team — not a big agency with layers of account managers. You'll work directly with the people doing the work. We focus on results over activity, and we're transparent about what's working and what isn't.

## Competitors to Be Aware Of

- **Big agencies (Thrive, WebFX, etc.):** We're smaller and more personal. You won't be passed around to junior staff. Our pricing is also typically more accessible.
- **Freelancers:** We offer more consistency and a broader skill set than a single freelancer, with proper processes and backup.
- **DIY tools (Wix, Squarespace marketing):** Great for getting started, but if you're ready to level up, we can take you further.

## Special Offers / Current Promotions

We occasionally run promotions — ask if there's anything current! We also offer a referral bonus if you send other businesses our way.

## Emergency / Urgent Situations

If someone has an urgent issue (website down, major problem):
"I understand this is urgent. Let me get your contact information and I'll make sure someone from our team reaches out within the hour to help you."

For existing clients with emergencies, they likely have direct contact info — but if they call this line, prioritize getting them connected quickly.
